## Example - Turbo Encabulator
The original machine had a base-plate of prefabulated aluminite, surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the **two** main spurving bearings were in a direct line with the pentametric fan. 
The latter consisted simply of **six** hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented. 
The main winding was of the normal lotus-o-delta type placed in panendermic semi-bovoid slots in the stator, every **seventh** conductor being connected by a non-reversible tremie pipe to the differential girdlespring on the "_up_" end of the grammeters.
